# discordbot

A discord bot that I'm learning to work on in my leisure time that has very limited functionality as of now.

The only package I'm currently importing is discord.py [credits https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py], which is why I'm going to refrain from creating a requirements.txt file at the moment.

To install discord.py, run pip install discord.py in your terminal window.
